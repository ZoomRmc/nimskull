### Purpose


We want to make sustainable technology with a diverse and cohesive community. In the same way that we follow best software engineering practices based on research and community experiences, we follow the latest evidence in the inclusion of a Code of Conduct (CoC) and its design. We welcome feedback.

<details><summary><b>Show more</b></summary><br />


We understand and empathise with serious concerns that CoC may represent a loss of freedom of speech, inhibit personal expression or bring unnecessary discussion in what should be the development of technology.

To these concerns, we can say that evidence based research has thus far demonstrated that Codes of Conduct are instrumental to demonstrating, and enforcing inclusive communities which allows a diverse set of skills and perspectives to prosper. Meritocracy is not sustainable outside of interactions between absolute equals (including cultural norms and understandings).

> *"Discrimination and bad culture in tech firms cost sixteen billion dollars a year to the tech industry... people, especially minorities leaving the company because of being discriminated against ... are less likely to refer others to join ... can limit the company's access to talented employees..."*[1]

> *"[Among a sample set of FOSS projects, it was concluded] that the adoption of a [CoC] is statistically neglible ... differentiating the failed projects from the most popular ones... [However] they note that not one of the failed projects had a [CoC], nor did any included in the 'least popular' category... some of the developers of the failed projects considered cited 'conflict among developers' as a reason for failure."*[1]

> *"Core open source values include transparency, openness, and meritocracy"*[2]

> *"[No Code of Conduct movements] emphasizes that people's political or social identity should be irrelevant in open source: 'We don't care if you're liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything in between! In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask. We simply do not care' ... the very concept of meritocracy in and of itself is problematic in encouraging a broader set of voices to participate, and allows users to sidestep the issues of inclusion and diversity altogether."*[3]

> *"... modern OSS communities are 'embedded with cultural values that tenasciously support free speech expression' which allow for hostile, sexist, or homophobic speech to flourish."*[2]

## Scope

In-line with scholarly literature, this Code of Conduct applies to spaces both online and offline.

<details><summary><b>Explanation of spaces included and to what degree</b></summary><br />

Online spaces managed by Nim-Works organisation will be held to the standards here. Spaces that represent our users (or where the users are otherwise representing Nim-Works) may still be held accountable to the standards here (in regards to their status as an official member of the organisation) depending on the context.

Offline spaces where members interact such as at Open Source Conferences (not excluding others) will be held to the same standards listed below.

> For example, a publicly known member of the community which is discovered to actively, and repeatedly, be insulting and threatening members in other public online spaces will have their actions investigated according to these standards.

## Code of Conduct

Simplicity is best. However we recognise that "simple" is a very subjective and non-inclusive term in itself. Therefore, we have outlined the main values of our Code of Conduct; however, you are able to expand the sections below particular values to see more specific themes and rules that contribute to the value.

1. <details><summary>We are an open and inclusive community, so I should behave in a manner which is respectful of others without discrimination.</summary><br />

   1. Discrimination against an individual(s) or group(s) damages the community and attacks the goals of our contributions; we specifically will not discriminate based on:
      1. Virtue of race or ethnicity; country of origin, or country of residence; gender(s), biological sex or sexual orientation; age or experience; economic standing or education; disability - physical or otherwise. Not listed are not excluded.
   2. Harassment - online or otherwise are not tolerated. This includes any offensive, belittling or threatening behaviour toward an individual(s) or group(s).
      1. Cultural diversity and language barriers may play a critical role in differentiating whether a perpetrator intentionally meant to be aggressive in their behaviour. Patience is crucial in investigating these cases.

</details>

2. <details><summary>Contribution does not entitle me or anyone else to act in any way that is not conducive to making this a productive and enjoyable environment</summary><br />

    1. Status within the organisation or technical skill does not allow someone to be exempt from the rules.
       1. The community does not owe any individual, irregardless of the size of their contributions or financial investments.
    2. Members with greater responsibility (eg: moderators) are held to much higher expectations than others. We believe in leading by example.
       1. The status of a community moderator is a privilege, but also a responsibility.
       2. Moderators may step down if they do not feel they are able to uphold these responsibilities.
    3. We should be patient with new or less experienced members; our contributions do not entitle us to belittle others (which would be indicative of harassment/discrimination)

</details>

3. <details><summary>We welcome new users; whether they be contributors, testers, documentation editors, or someone interested in our work. We will help those who need a hand getting started (within reason) with the same patience we would expect someone to give us.</summary><br />

    1. The cost toward the community for onboarding new members should not be expected to be unreasonable. We will provide the resources and guidance for members to learn, however we cannot be expected to provide a teaching service.
       1. Everyone starts at a different point and we will be patient in providing resources
       2. Simple answers such as "look at the manual" are not tolerable; these questions and their answers will likely be viewed again in the future by users through search engines and should therefore be treated appropriately.
       3. However, we recognise that it is not reasonable for repeated contributions to be fixed without any effort from the contributor to remedy their mistakes.
    2. First impressions matter; we are a good community who will welcome and share with those who are willing to learn.
       1. Failure to adapt can lead to an unreasonable cost to the community to maintain membership.
       2. This may create situations which may seem contradictory. I understand however that this is in recognition of Code of Conduct item 4.

</details>

4. <details><summary>We understand the expectations of us to act according to values and not technicalities.</summary><br />

    1. The intolerable will never be tolerable. We will play by the rules as intended. Where it is not seen as discriminatory, people who try to excuse poor behaviour as not being written clearly within the Code of Conduct will be treated as if it was
       1. As an example: Discussions such as questioning the legitimacy of genocidal events in history are inexcusable. It being framed as a question or due to ones own ignorance will be investigated under the *reasonable person principle* and punished appropriately.
          1. We do not expect situations like this to arise; our conversation should mostly be productive; however, we are an enjoyable group of people who will no doubt discuss different aspects of life.

</details>

5. <details><summary>Contribution implicitly registers acknowledgement of this Code of Conduct.</summary><br />

    1. Ignorance of the rules is not a valid argument for breaking them.

</details>

6. <details><summary>I/We will work towards keeping this environment productive by ensuring behaviour is correct to this Code of Conduct.</summary><br />

    1. If you see someone being harassed, speak up. We will support you, and whole heartedly thank you.
    2. Silence can sometimes be worse than agreeing with a harassor/perpetrator.
    3. If you are concerned due to some connection to the aggressor and do not wish to alienate yourselves from them, please contact us and we will handle the situation with complete confidentiality.
       1. Please see the code for enforcement below.

</details>

## Enforcement

When enforcing the Code of Conduct, especially in cases involving non-native English speakers, we encourage patience, empathy, understanding, and willingness to educate and inform. In context where the breach is deemed *intentional*, we will pursue enforcement of the Code of Conduct as described.

> *"People from different backgrounds are likely to have different interpretations of what words or behaviors are considered acceptable. It's somewhat ironic that in an attempt to draw a more diverse developer base, code of conduct moderation, if improperly conducted, could potentially alienate users from other countries who don't have the same social conditioning as those in North America [or other Western cultures]."*[2]

1. The Code of Conduct can be enforced through a range of passive and active means. We recommend minimal use for first offenders but allow rapid escalation if required (depending on the severity of the breach).
2. Passive means may include a public warning against members of the community in general breaching the Code of Conduct. Where a moderator is involved in the conversation in question,  we strongly recommend against that moderator being the instigator of this warning if possible. Passive means may also involve reminders of good examples and bad examples of behaviour relating to the code of conduct.
3. Active means may range from temporary communicative suppression (mutes), temporary bans, to permanent bans.
4. Moderators must assemble evidence for punishments enacted should they be requested to provide it.
   1. The moderator is not required to include their interpretation or deliberation of the material. This however may be raised by the aggrieved party (or a representative) in which case the decision will be reviewed within 7 days by another moderator who is independent of the first.

<!-- If a member of the community or public is ever concerned with any actions of our moderation or code of conduct, they may let any of our moderators know. Should they feel this is inadequate or inappropriate for whatever reason, they may communicate with @shayanhabibi. Communications will be confidential unless told otherwise. -->

<!-- ## Revision

Revision of this document would require a democratic decision involving the majority of active Nim-Works organisational members within 7 days of the revision proposed. This does not apply when the revision does not meaningfully change the content within (ie it is related to formatting) -->
